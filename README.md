# Pyber-Analysis

## Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to analyze and examine the difference in ride-share data for each city type: Rural, Suburban, and Urban. The analysis included a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data for each city type which included total drivers, total rides, total fares, and so on. To add, the analysis also included a multiple-line gaph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type, to get more insight into how the city types differ in terms of Pyber fares.

## Results

Something that was noticeable was that the average number of rides in the rural area is about 3.5 lower than the urban cities and 2.5 times lower than the suburban cities. On the same note, the average fare price is higher for the rural city type compared to the other 2 city types. We also noticed that the average fare for rides in the rural cities is about $11 more than urban cities and $5 more than suburban cities.

## Summary
I would suggest that we try to lower the costs of rides in rural cities, in order to make it more accessible to people who cannot afford to pay the high fares but need transportation. Another suggestion would be to create incentives to increase the amount of active PyBer drivers in rural areas so that the cost of fares go down, just like the case in urban and suburban cities. Lastly, I would try to create work or school programs that partner with PyBer to get discounted rates on fares so that there are more people using the ride-sharing service.
